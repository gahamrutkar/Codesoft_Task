# Step 1: Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Step 2: Load and preprocess the data
# Let's assume you have a CSV file named 'sales_data.csv' with columns: 'Advertising', 'Sales'.
data = pd.read_csv('/content/advertising.csv')

# Handle missing values if any
data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Split the data into features (X) and target (y)
X = data[['TV']]

# Split the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)

# Step 3: Model Selection and Training
model = LinearRegression()

# Step 4: Model Evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate evaluation metrics
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Let's assume you have a new dataset with advertising expenditure in the 'new_advertising' column.
